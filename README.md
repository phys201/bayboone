# BayBooNE: Baysian Booster Neutrino Experiment

This package will develop tools for Bayesian analysis of the sterile neutrino problem, focused on functionality for data from LAr-TPCs and similar detectors, and based on the MicroBooNE experiment and the Booster Nuetrino Beam at Fermilab.

This package is based on the example package produced as a template for assignment 10 of the Physics 201: Data Analysis for Physicists course at Harvard in Spring 2020.

To run the tests, from the main bayboone directory run:

    python setup.py test
